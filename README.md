#Node.js

What is Node.j
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side and build scalable, high-performance web applications. Node.js provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it lightweight and efficient, and enables it to handle large amounts of data and concurrent connections with ease. Node.js provides a rich set of modules and libraries that developers can use to build applications quickly and easily. It also has a large and active community that creates and maintains these modules, making it easy to find solutions to common problems and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices.
